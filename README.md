# Auto GitLab Projects Backup

This project allows you to automatically make clone of all repos in your GitLab account.
&nbsp;

## Prerequisites
For this project to work, it is sufficient to have **Python3** and **Git** installed on your device.

## Configure
After cloning the project, copy the ``config.py.dist`` file named ``config.py``. Then, enter your access key that you have granted **API** permission in **config.py** from https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens page.

*Important!* If your GIT session is not provided over SSH on your device, you should set the ``repoUrlType`` value to ``http``.
